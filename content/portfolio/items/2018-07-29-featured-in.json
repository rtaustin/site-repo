  "body": "Handling playback monitoring is a herculean effort. One of the great challenges is not just delivering millions of simultaneous streams but also ensuring they arrive healthy. To understand the health of a stream hundreds of metrics are pulled, cross referenced and calculated. With each stream segment being only 2-4 seconds long, metrics for millions of concurrent sessions pile up extremely quickly.\n\nThis monumental amount of data needs to be analyzed, visualized, and alerted on. For a live event like the NBA Finals or Superbowl knowing if your stream has gone bad is absolutely critical. Just a few minutes can cost a network millions of dollars. \\\n\\\nTo ensure monitoring is as close to live as possible, Verizon Media developers, through doctorate research, developed a revolutionary method of monitoring playback right at the CDN (Content Delivery Network).   \\\n\\\nWe wanted to further enhance the usefulness of the research by our monitoring interfaces with a whole slew of new visualizations and interactions that customers and operators could use to interact with the data, make correlations, and solve playback problems.  \n\n![](/images/uploads/cdn-monitoring.jpg)"
